This is a chat app created with Node JS, Socket.io library, and EJS. 

It allows persistent user sessions. That means that a user can be in the same chat thread in multiple devices. 

The difficulty in building this app is tracking down all the information that is generated and passed around. 

The authentication doen't include password security yet because I haven't had time to implement it.
