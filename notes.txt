Error: When someone joins private chatroom, main chatroom also gets the message

1/31/24
list of online users in private chat is not working

I am considering add notifications back to private chat

//This code is problematic because it shares the same broadcast name as the public one
//save session info in client side in private chats  
socket.emit("user info received", sessionInfo)

The existing chat room list in private messages still need work.

Need to work on:
1. Online user list on the menu for both public and private 
2. private disconnect message
3. If the user joins a room, his status needs to be updated as online

There is a flaw with how online users list is rendered in each room.
It's based on the user's connected status. 
It should be based on the number of socket id's that the users has. 

Need to work on MessageStore.disconnectMessage

//Broadcasts message to everyone 
io.emit("private message", `This is a test: ${genKey(100)}`)

//Broadcast message only to the owner of the socket
socket.emit("private message", `This is a test: ${genKey(100)}`)

//Owner of the socket broadcasts the message, but he doesn't receive his own message
socket.broacast.emit("private message", `${newUser.username} has joined the chat`)
