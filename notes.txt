//This code is problematic because it shares the same broadcast name as the public one
//save session info in client side in private chats  
socket.emit("user info received", sessionInfo)

The existing chat room list in private messages still need work.

Need to work on:
1. Online user list on the menu for both public and private 
2. private disconnect message
3. If the user joins a room, his status needs to be updated as online

There is a flaw with how online users list is rendered in each room.
It's based on the user's connected status. 
It should be based on the number of socket id's that the users has. 

Need to work on MessageStore.disconnectMessage
